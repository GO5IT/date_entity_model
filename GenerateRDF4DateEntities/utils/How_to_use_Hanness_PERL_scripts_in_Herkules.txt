How to use Hannes's PERL scripts in Herkules to produce Linked Open Date Entities in RDF

# If data processing would continue, after you switch your computer off, use a screen session. If not, ignore this part
type: screen -S your_session_name
leave the screen session by executing: ctrl + a + d
return back to the screen session type: screen -r.
to kill a screen, type: exit

# Docker to start
docker-manage -e go-perl -a enter
(OR shortcut is "perl-enter")

# If Docker needs to be restarted, do this before above
docker-manage -e go-perl -a build

# Run script from anywhere, but be awere three files are needed in the same folder to run it. Normally the default path is /home/go/Date_Entity_Model/GenerateRDF4DateEntities/utils


A) Script to generate Date Entities (rdf/xml)
See https://redmine.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/issues/17311

1. run_generate_tests.sh, the main script to run
2. generate_xxxx_rdf.pl (e.g. generate_year_rdf.pl), which configure the data generation for the level of entity (year, month etc)
3. DateRDFUtils.pm, a module which is imported to pl

sample_${type}.rdf (name specified run_generate_tests.sh) will be generated as output

B) Script to enrich Date Entities by adding more info from Linked Open Data (eg DBpedia and Wikidata)
See details: https://redmine.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/issues/17474 (The success rate of this script is 50%+ for unknown technical problems for chracter encoding. It would be best to split the complete task into a couple of subtasks in order to avoid repeating them. In particular, DBpedia and Wikdiata can be done step by step)

# Run the script with options
./run_add_existing.sh (-h) (-d) (-S <SKIP_N>) (-L <LIMIT_M>) <INPUT RDF-FILE>
(example command: ./run_add_existing.sh -d -S 50 -L 5 sample_year.rdf)

	OPTIONS:
	-S  <SKIP_N>         Skip <SKIP_N> years before starting to process
	-L  <LIMIT_M>        Limit processing to a total of <LIMIT_M> years
    	                 "0" means: there is NO limit
	-d                   Debug mode
	-h                   Print this message

The new script generates the following files with the timestamp of their creation:
1. .rdf : generated RDF file
2. .csv log-info provide info about statistics of processing
3. csv.dump : the same info as .csv but in a format similar to .json -> useers can ignore / DELETE
4. log...txt : most detailed logging during processing: it records many of the decisions and is valuable in the case Hannes need to debug. -> Users can ignore / but NOT delete


----
# After rdf/xml is generated, it could be transformed to another format such as turtle (ttl) that would be handier.

riot format transformation tool is preinstalled in Jena Fuseki which works with a command line

How to use Hannes's PERL scripts in Herkules

# Docker to start
docker-manage -e go-perl -a enter
(OR shortcut is "perl-enter")

# If Docker needs to be restarted, do this before above
docker-manage -e go-perl -a build

# Run script from anywhere, but be awere three files are needed in the same folder to run it. Normally the default path is /home/go/Date_Entity_Model/GenerateRDF4DateEntities/utils


A) Script to generate Date Entities 
1. run_generate_tests.sh, the main script to run
2. generate_xxxx_rdf.pl (e.g. generate_year_rdf.pl), which configure the data generation for the level of entity (year, month etc)
3. DateRDFUtils.pm, a module which is imported to pl

B) Script to enrich Date Entities by adding more info from Linked Open Data (eg DBpedia and Wikidata)
# Run the script with options
./run_add_existing.sh (-h) (-d) (-S <SKIP_N>) (-L <LIMIT_M>) <RDF-XML-FILE>
(example command: run_add_existing.sh -d -S 50 -L 5 ad1-100.rdf)

The new script generates the following files with the timestamp of their creation:
1. .rdf : generated RDF file
2. .csv log-info provide info about statistics of processing
3. csv.dump : the same info as .csv but in a format similar to .json -> useers can ignore / DELETE
4. log...txt : most detailed logging during processing: it records many of the decisions and is valuable in the case Hannes need to debug. -> Users can ignore / but NOT delete
